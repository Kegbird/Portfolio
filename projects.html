    <h2>Block Game</h2>
    <p>
        Block Game is another C++ game prototype implemented with the SFML library. It's a very minimal Candy Crush clone which 
        offers 2 types of power ups, sounds and scores storage.
        This is a very small prototype, implemented just to study what offers the SFML library.

    <h2>AGraph</h2>
    <p>
        AGraph is an augmented reality application for iOS that allows to plot, over a designed image, 3d point graphs; 
        each graph is defined by a csv file which describes a list of 3d points and colours. 
        These csv files loaded from the application are downloaded from a dropbox directory.

    <h2>Order Please</h2>
    <p>
        Order Please is a management application developed for my family (my family runs a restaurant); it's composed from 4
        parts, all using a database in which are stored dishes, drinks and all other things that can be sold to our customers.
        These 4 parts are:
        <ul>
            <li>An android application</li>
            <li>A db management desktop application</li>
            <li>A desktop application which simulates a cashdesk</li>
            <li>A small web service which espose db data</li>
        </ul>
        The android application is used by waiters allowing them to take orders from customers: all orders taken 
        are received by the cashdesk application that stores all item ordered from each table in the service room.
        The cashdesk application receives all order: each order maybe will contains different voices, each one with a different category, 
        so the application splits the received order into many, printing them on different printers; for instance, all drinks are redirected to a printer in the bar, all dishes 
        into the kitchen's one etc. etc.
        Before the customer leaves, the application prints a brief resum of all dishes and drinks ordered by him/her.
    </p>
    <h2>Common design patterns</h2>
    <p>
        Design patterns are extremely important to build scalable and maintanable code: this is the reason why I created 
        this repository: it's a collection of C++ examples of all well known design patterns.
        The repository is currently work in progress.

    <h2>Hot Stuff!</h2>
    <p>
        Hot Stuff is a multiplayer game developed with Unreal Engine; it's a mix between Rocket League and Mario Kart:
        each
        player control a tanky kart with which has to launch a bomb ball into the enemy base (in order to make points),
        exploiting boosts and power ups that spawn in the battleground.
        The team which gathers more points wins.

    <h2>Filters comparison</h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of this project was to compare different parallel implementations of notorious computer graphics
        filter, such
        as Canny, Module and Robert, with their classic sequential version.
        All parallel implementations exploits and combine different features offered by NVIDIA GPU, throught the
        framework CUDA.
